6. Other pages created
1. Navbar - For header and footer where the user menu, title and the links to other pages will be available.It is responsive and will be common across all pages . code is referenced fro [5] but modified to include my own pages, changed the look and feel.It has a default template from bootstrap.

2. Slider pages 
1. Taken from attributions [3],[4],[5].  Took the code for this part from these references and modified it to my specification for the sake of including it in the project. Have tried using React carousel instead but it didn't work correctly.
